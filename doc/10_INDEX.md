# Internal fritz2 documentation

The markdown files in this directory (`doc/`) are meant to document the inner workings of the `fritz2` project.

Compared to the website that is primarily used for _user documentation_, this documentation contains information on 
how certain project-specific workflows like publishing the website and source code work.
