## Yesterday

In late 2019 Jens Stegemann and Jan Weidenhaupt have started to investigate the possibilities to create web driven
frontends in Kotlin based upon the brand new multi platform approach (which was hardly in alpha state), in order to
streamline the internal development of the insurance company, they have worked for at this time.

The dream was to have one language for the backend, which was almost pure Java at the time, and the frontend, which was
a mixture of Javascript based frameworks, some experimental Scala approach.

Kotlin's multi platform vision seemed to be the game changer to achieve this!

If only there had been some web framework available - which simply was not the case...

... but you all know the result: fritz2 was born and has been actively developed and polished until today.
Over the time, new developers were attracted and merged into the core development team.

## Today

The initial dream has become reality by the way: The technology mix is almost streamlined and there are some dozens of UI
fritz2 based applications and backend-services (using the fritz2 validation) in production - also by 3rd party
organizations!

fritz2 has meanwhile become solid, stable und works reliable in production.

As time goes by, personal interests and professional duties have changed, so Jens and Jan both has left the company and
moved on to other projects and technologies.

The fritz2 development still continued, as the core team has been already strong enough to compensate their retirements.

In fact, we hope you have not recognized this at all until now, as for the last two years, this was the way it worked.

In order to reflect those changes and make the deployment work easier for the core devs, we have lately decided
to create a new github organization to bundle all official fritz2 projects into one place.
So checkout the [https://github.com/fritztwo] organization, if you have not done this yet.

You can get the core-framework, and the two template-projects from there. There are also some smaller projects, which
acts as helper or playground for future developments.

This website's URL and the maven-central repository remain the same! As we have suggested, as a user of the framework
those changes are almost agnostic. You must not change anything inside your projects.

## Tomorrow

fritz2 is still on its road to version 1.0. We believe there is not much work left to do, mostly some polishment of
missing API features and documentation. We are looking forward to achieve this status soon - not later than 2026,
we promise this right now!

We have also plans for the evolvement after the 1.0 release. Those will cover some core framework topics, like some
rework of store's behaviour, but also some ideas to add some headless components and more abilities of the
lenses-generator.

So stay tuned and be curious for the upcoming releases!

(Trivia: The title of this article is derived from the
[german title](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestern,_heute,_morgen) 
of the brilliant last episode of the last Star Trek episode of the famous TNG series. It is so fitting - besides 
our saga continues 😉)

## Final words

As this shift into an organization could be seen as a last step of a smooth handover to new developers, we are happy to
present you some final greeting of the fritz2's initiator Jens Stegemann:

> "When we have started this project, it was our aim to craft some lightweight and easy usable web framework based upon
> Kotlin, to enable a consistent and nice user experience throughout the different software layers. fritz2 has filled
> the original gap so well, I could have never imagined!"
> 
> "It is always hard to give up some project and move on, but I am so grateful, that we were able to open the
> development in early days and attract new contributors over the time, so that the development could be continued
> without me and Jan."
> 
> "I can promise you out there, that fritz2 is in the best hands possible!"

Thank you, Jens and Jan for your passion and dedication over the years!
